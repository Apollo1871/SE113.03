            <h2><b>Review</b></h2>
            <h3>Ben Ali</h3>
            <h3><em>04/19/2025</em></h3>

            <p><em>Casablanca</em> (1942), directed by Michael Curtiz, is a timeless classic that masterfully blends romance, political intrigue, and moral conflict. Set against the backdrop of World War II in the titular Moroccan city, the film centers on Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), a cynical nightclub owner whose world is turned upside down when his former lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks back into his life with her resistance-leader husband, Victor Laszlo. The film’s sharp screenplay, iconic lines, and evocative atmosphere have helped cement its place as one of the greatest movies in cinema history.</p>

            <p>The performances are unforgettable, particularly Bogart’s portrayal of Rick, a man torn between personal desire and a greater cause. Bergman brings emotional depth and grace to Ilsa, and the chemistry between the two is both palpable and tragic. Supporting roles, like Claude Rains as the charming yet morally ambiguous Captain Renault and Dooley Wilson as Sam, add richness to the ensemble. The film’s haunting theme song, “As Time Goes By,” lingers long after the credits roll, underscoring the nostalgia and emotional complexity of Rick and Ilsa’s story.</p>

            <p>Beyond its romance, <em>Casablanca</em> resonates because of its exploration of sacrifice, loyalty, and the gray areas of wartime morality. The script weaves these themes into a gripping narrative without ever feeling heavy-handed. It’s a film that rewards multiple viewings, not just for its historical significance but for its enduring emotional impact. In the final moments, when Rick makes his fateful decision on the tarmac, <em>Casablanca</em> transcends the genre and becomes something more—an ode to lost love, resilience, and doing the right thing even when it hurts.</p>

            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            
            <div class="info">

                <ul>
                    <li><b>"Here's looking at you, kid" was improvised.</b> Humphrey Bogart ad-libbed this now-iconic line, and it became one of the most famous in film history.</li>

                    <li><b>The airport finale was filmed with miniatures.</b> Due to budget constraints and wartime restrictions, the famous foggy airport scene used a small cardboard plane and little people (little people actors) in the background to simulate depth.</li>

                    <li><b>Bogart had to stand on boxes.</b> At 5'8", Bogart was significantly shorter than Ingrid Bergman (5'9") in heels, so he often stood on boxes or had Bergman slouch in scenes to balance the height difference.</li>

                    <li><b>It won three Academy Awards.</b><em> Casablanca</em> took home Best Picture, Best Director (Michael Curtiz), and Best Adapted Screenplay at the 1944 Oscars.</li>

                    <li><b>It was written on the fly.</b> The script wasn’t completed when filming began. In fact, the writers were often scrambling to finish scenes just ahead of shooting them, and the cast didn’t know how the film would end until it was shot.</li>
