        <p>My name is <b> Ben </b>and I enjoy the outdoors so I like to Hike, kayak and run and I plan to get into
            mountain bking in the summer.<i>I also like working out and watching movies. Some of my favorite movies are
            </i> Blade Runner 2049, Casablanca, and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<span style="color: blue;"> My
                favorite color is blue</span>and <u>I'm borderline addicted to eating sweets but i'm trying to
                cut them out.</u> Lastly, I don't play games as much as I used to <em>but some of my all time favorites
                are</em> Halo 3, Halo Reach, Hearts of Iron 4, and Death Stranding.</p>
